# OPC Layouts

This directory contains layout files for the OpenPixelControl server.

OpenPixelControl is used in this project as a simulator for the dance floor.  It provides a convenient visualization platform for the dance floor code, absent an actual dance floor.

Layouts are used with gl_server (found in the openpixelcontrol repository) like:

./gl_server -l some-layout.json
